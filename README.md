# Sample Size Estimator  
https://andrewabeles.shinyapps.io/power_calculator/

This is an app for estimating the sample size needed to run an experiment. It takes the following parameters as input: baseline, standard deviation (only for means), alpha, and power. It outputs the sample size per group required to detect a given effect size.

## Baseline
The baseline value of the variable being tested. The variable's proportion or average in the control group.

## Standard Deviation
The standard deviation of the baseline variable. Larger standard deviations require larger sample sizes to ensure the observed difference between groups is not due to the baseline variable's natural variance.

## Alpha
Also known as the significance level, alpha is the experiment's Type I error (false positive) rate.

## Power
1 - Beta, the Type II error or false negative rate. Power represents the probability the experiment will detect a given effect size at a given significance level.
